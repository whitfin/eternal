  # Basically, this module implements an extremely base GenServer which listens
  # on two messages - the first is that of ETS to trigger a log that the table
  # owner has changed, and the other is a recognisation that a new heir has been
  # attached and needs assigning to ETS (as only an owner can set the heir).

  # use default server behaviour
  use GenServer

  # add a Priv alias
  alias Eternal.Priv
